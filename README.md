### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a front-end student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media while also holding a 40% position as a teacher in concept development and programming at a high school. 
From time to time, I need to disconnect from the tech world, so I also have a small hobby-based company where I produce annexes, lean-tos, and benches using old traditional log cabin techniques

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on way to much

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ablout useing Wordpress as a headless cms, while my student are currently working on FLASK with python.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
